# Techno-Economic-Comparison-of-Electricity-Storage-Options-in-a-Fully-Renewable-Energy-System-Repo

This is the repository accompanying the paper Techno Economic Comparison of Electricity Storage Options in a Fully Renewable Energy System. In here, all code, data and spreadsheets that are used to generate the results can be found. The source code is split into the first part of the paper, the standalone comparison, and the second part of the paper, the integration study. The source code of the second part of the paper consists of the two excel files. The first part of the paper are the remaining files. The python code of the first part is made on python 3.8.10, using the Spyder 5 IDE. Some packages may need to be installed as can be seen in the imports. All files need to be in the same folder when run. 

Thank you for taking the time to play around with our models. We hope this has sparked new insights or inspiration. Please do not hesitate to reach out in case of questions. The full paper is under review at Energies.

The main Python file is Powermodel2-6 V3.py
